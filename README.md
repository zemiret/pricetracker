# How should I install this?

asically setup anacron cronjob that runs twice a day? (if I'm doing it locally)

# What else do I need?

* A server that serves the results
* A frontend that displays the results
* notification system that will shoot the message when the price gets below the defined threshold (+ defining the thresholds I guess)
* Extracting a watch-name within extractor (either from a page title, a caption, or URL)
* ... more connectors
